# RBE 550 - Basic Search Algorithms Implementation

## Overview

In this assignment, I have implemented **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra** and **A*** algorithms with Python 3. These are the basic algorithms for discrete planning, which also share a lot of similarities. A map to test different algorithms, and visualize the path found by them is also included.

Files included:

- **search.py** is the file where algorithms implement. 
- **main.py** is the scrip that provides helper functions that load the map from csv files and visualize the map and path. 
- **map.csv** is the map file you could modify to create your own map.
- **test_map.csv** restores a test map for doc test purpose only. Do not modify this file.

For visualization run:

`python main.py`

There should be 4 maps shown representing the results of 4 algorithms. As said before, there would be no path shown in the graph as you haven't implemented anything yet. The **main.py** loads the map file **map.csv**, which you are free to modify to create your own map.
